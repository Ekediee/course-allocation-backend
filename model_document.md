Key Fields:
- `name`, `is_active`: Session identifier and flag.

Relationships:
- One-to-many with `CourseAllocation`.

Why It Matters:
Enables session-based allocation tracking and historical views of who taught what, when.

🔹 CourseAllocation
Purpose:
Defines the actual assignment of a lecturer to a course for a specific session.

Key Fields:
- `program_course_id`, `session_id`, `semester_id`, `lecturer_id`: The core allocation links.
- `group_name`: Optional, for splitting a course into groups (e.g., "Group A").

- Belongs to `ProgramCourse`, `AcademicSession`, `Semester`, and `Lecturer`.
- `pushed_by`: A relationship to the `User` who pushed the allocation to UMIS.
- `source_bulletin`: A relationship to the `Bulletin` for DE allocations.

Why It Matters:
Tracks the actual delivery of courses, supporting multi-lecturer assignments, group-based teaching, DE allocations, and integration with external systems.

✅ Conclusion: System Strengths
🔁 Curriculum Versioning: Bulletins allow for flexible, historical curriculum tracking.
👥 Lecturer Grouping: Supports team-teaching and group splitting for large classes.
📊 Session-Based Allocation: Keeps history of each academic year cleanly organized.
🧱 Role-Based Access: Differentiates between admin, HODs, and lecturers.

🔹 DepartmentAllocationState
Purpose:
Tracks the submission and vetting status of course allocations for a department on a per-semester, per-session basis. This model is central to the "submit and lock" workflow.

Key Fields:
- `department_id`: Links to the `Department`.
- `session_id`: Links to the `AcademicSession`.
- `semester_id`: Links to the `Semester`.
- `is_submitted`: A boolean flag (`True`/`False`) indicating if the allocation is locked for editing by the HOD.
- `submitted_at`: Timestamp of when the submission occurred.
- `submitted_by_id`: The user (HOD) who submitted the allocation.
- `is_vetted`: A boolean flag indicating if the allocation has been approved by a vetter/admin.
- `vetted_at`: Timestamp of when the vetting occurred.
- `vetted_by_id`: The user who vetted the allocation.

Constraints:
- Composite uniqueness on `(department_id, session_id, semester_id)` ensures that there is only one submission state record per department, per semester, per session.

Relationships:
- Belongs to `Department`, `AcademicSession`, `Semester`.
- `submitted_by`: A relationship to the `User` who submitted.
- `vetted_by`: A relationship to the `User` who vetted.

Why It Matters:
This model enables the workflow where HODs can finalize and "submit" their allocations, locking them from further edits. It also allows administrators to "vet" (approve) or "unblock" these submissions. This provides a clear and robust state management system for the course allocation process.

🔹 AppSetting
Purpose:
Stores global application settings that can be changed at runtime without deploying new code, such as enabling or disabling maintenance mode.

Key Fields:
- `setting_name`: The unique name of the setting (e.g., 'maintenance_mode').
- `is_enabled`: A boolean flag indicating the status of the setting.
- `updated_at`: Timestamp for when the setting was last modified.

Why It Matters:
Provides a flexible way for administrators to manage the application's behavior in real-time, enhancing operational control.
